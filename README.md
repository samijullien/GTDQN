# GLDQN

## Requirements
You need R with the copula package. Dependencies are managed with poetry - you just need to create an environment from it.

## Running
To run the script, simply configure the yaml file with your agent's name (found in code_base), environment parameters and run the following command:
python main.py


Additional parameters can be tweaked.
